### Hello ðŸ‘‹

The Food Chain is a new food delivery app that aims to address the problem of high prices on popular food delivery apps. The app is built on blockchain technology, which makes it less expensive to scale and more transparent, reliable and tamper-proof. It operates on a commission-based business model, where a small percentage of each transaction is taken as a fee. The app aims to compete with other food delivery apps such as Uber Eats, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes by providing more value to customers, drivers and restaurants.

Please note:
*The Food Chain project was a capstone project placed in the top 3 among all the projects presented (40+). It is only a proof-of-concept at this stage, meaning it is not yet a fully functional product. The proof-of-concept is used to demonstrate the idea's potential, and the minimal viable product (MVP) is the next step in the development process. An MVP is a simplified product with the essential features to satisfy early customers and validate the concept. The goal of an MVP is to test the product's feasibility and gather feedback before fully developing the product. Therefore, The Food Chain project is currently only in the proof-of-concept phase and is working on building a minimal viable product.*
